# Linux-Shell

## Problem Statement
Build a simple shell to execute user commands, much like the bash shell in Linux. This will deepen your understanding of various concepts of process management in Linux. Implement `exec`, `wait` system calls, simple shell commands like `grep`, `echo`, `cat`, `sleep`, `ls`, `ps`, `top` and deep system calls such as `kill()`, `signal()` and `sigaction()`. Proper `forking` has to be implemented also.
